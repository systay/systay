### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm AndrÃ©s, and I am a database developer. I've spent the last ten years writing query planners and runtime engines for Neo4j and Vitess. Most of that work is available here on github.

I'm currently working on making Vitess emulate MySQL better.

Here are some projects I worked on that I think are extra cool:
   * The [planner](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/tree/4.2/community/cypher/cypher-planner/src/main/scala/org/neo4j/cypher/internal/compiler/planner/logical) that Neo4j uses to plan Cypher queries. It's an implementation of a very interesting [paper](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.43.4235&rep=rep1&type=pdf) on how to do relational query optimization that we adapted to be used for graph queries.
   
   * Specifiyng a database query language. Cypher (Neo4j's) query language started as a 20% project as Neo4j, but grew to be the main interface for Neo4j. Today it's used by thousands of developers, and there are [multiple](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089DSXN3Q) [books](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KCHOXZE) [written](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083ND9B27) about it. First leading the work of specifying the language and then being part of the push to standardize it with ANSI was a great learning experience and something I'm proud of.
   
   * The Morsel runtime in Neo4j. I was part of the inception of this project, but left before it made it into production. It's an implementation of this [paper](http://cs.brown.edu/~kayhan/papers/morsel_cp.pdf), and enables a single query to run on multiple threads, or a single thread to switch between multiple running queries.

   * The [compiled runtime](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/tree/3.2/enterprise/cypher/cypher-compiled-runtime-3.2/src/main/scala/org/neo4j/cypher/internal/compiled_runtime/v3_2) used by Neo4j. Again, it's the implementation of a [paper](https://w6113.github.io/files/papers/p539-neumann.pdf). It allows Cypher queries to be compiled to bytecode to run faster. This is another project that I was part of during it's start, but I left before it was done-done-done.
   
   * The MySQL compatability project at [Vitess](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/). The project was about making Vitess emulating MySQL in more situations, and lead to rewriting a lot of the planner and runtime components of the query handler in Vitess.
