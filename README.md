### Hi there üëã

I'm Andr√©s, a seasoned database developer with a decade of expertise in designing query planners and runtime engines. My journey has been deeply intertwined with Neo4j and Vitess, and you can find much of my work here on GitHub.

üöÄ **Current Focus**: Enhancing Vitess to more effectively emulate MySQL.

üìù **Blogs and Papers**: 
- Explore my insights: [My Blog](http://systay.github.io/)
- Proud contributor to academic papers, frequently cited in scholarly circles. [View my papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZA9AZq4AAAAJ&hl=en&citsig=AMD79opH4qlRfuM1_GJiZiiZ4PJ1BKviWQ)

üåü **Highlighted Projects**:
- **PlanetScale's Boost Caching System**: Developed the planner for this innovative caching system, introducing a unique approach where operators in the plan tree can be reused multiple times, transforming the plan-tree into a plan DAG.
- **Grouping and Aggregation Across Shards in Vitess**: Implemented the Local Aggregation algorithm from the [Orthogonal Optimization of Subqueries and Aggregation](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.563.8492&rep=rep1&type=pdf) paper to optimize aggregation across join operations.

- **New Query Optimizer for Vitess**: Spearheading the development of a [new query optimizer](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/7280) based on the GOO paper, adapted for Vitess's sharded plans.
- **MySQL Compatibility Project for Vitess**: Played a key role in enhancing Vitess's emulation of MySQL, leading to significant rewrites in Vitess's planner and runtime components.
- **Neo4j's Cypher Query Planner**: Contributed to the development of the planner for Cypher queries, based on a novel approach to relational query optimization adapted for graph queries.
- **Creation of Cypher, Neo4j's Query Language**: Led the initiative to specify and standardize Cypher, which has since become the primary interface for thousands of developers worldwide. [Cypher Specification](https://github.com/opencypher/openCypher)
- **Morsel Runtime in Neo4j**: Instrumental in the early stages of the Morsel runtime project, enabling more efficient query processing.
- **Compiled Runtime for Neo4j**: Involved in the initial development of Neo4j's compiled runtime, allowing Cypher queries to be executed faster by compiling them to bytecode.

üèÜ **Proud Achievements**:
- Significant contributions to open-source projects like Vitess and Neo4j
- Author of influential blog posts and academic papers

I'm always eager to collaborate and discuss innovative ideas in database development. Feel free to reach out!
